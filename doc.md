### Web technology reference

HTML — Structuring the web
HyperText Markup Language is used to define and describe semantically the content (markup) of a web page in a well-structured format. HTML provides a means to create structured documents made up of blocks called HTML elements that are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Some introduce content into the page directly, others provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Obviously, browsers do not display them, since they are used to interpret the content of the page.

CSS — Styling the web
Cascading Style Sheets are used to describe the appearance of web content.

JavaScript — Dynamic client-side scripting
The JavaScript programming language is used to add interactivity and other dynamic features to web sites.
